Introduction
Veterinary teaching hospitals have many different species of animals in close proximity to one another. The environment can be a potential source and reservoir for the transmission of Salmonella in a veterinary hospital. Salmonella is the most commonly associated agent responsible for nosocomial outbreaks among veterinary teaching hospitals. A study of the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine (AUCVM) Veterinary Teaching Hospital was conducted to better understand the dynamics of Salmonella in the environment and prevalence of Salmonella within a multi-species animal facility. Additional studies were conducted to evaluate Salmonella in the on-site dairy herd and among the environment of the Equine Reproduction Center. A total of 1395 samples were collected over the different surveillance projects. From those projects, ten samples were sent to the United State Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Service Laboratory (NVSL) for whole-genome sequencing (WGS). It is important to determine whether these isolates are the same strain or derived from a common ancestor. This projectâ€™s aim is to develop a pipeline to process the raw WGS data from the NVSL. Other veterinary teaching hospitals can utilize this set of scripts and procedures for epidemiological studies using WGS data.

Detailed Description of the project

Aim
The general aim of this project is to develop a pipeline for veterinary teaching hospitals to use to process raw whole genome sequence data for epidemiological studies. The specific aim for this project is to determine the genetic variability among isolates from these ten samples.
