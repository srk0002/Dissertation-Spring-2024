Bacteriophages (phage), a virus of bacteria, have been proposed as a preharvest intervention to reduce or eliminate common foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella Newport. Concerns with phage-resistance emerging from the use of phage have led to further studies of phage-resistance in a calf model. A previous study of a phage-resistant mutant of Salmonella Newport exhibited attenuation. When co-inoculated with the phage-sensitive parent Salmonella Newport, both phage-sensitive and phage-resistant Salmonella Newport had a prolonged, high shed of Salmonella. The parent and phage-resistant Salmonella Newport were sequenced to identify the mutation responsible for the phage-resistance. After different approaches, a hybrid assembly combining short-read and long-read sequencing identified a mutation in the rfbM gene, which is important in LPS biosynthesis. This detected mutation is proposed to be responsible for the resistance to five out of five of the phage cocktail used in the Salmonella Newport calf model for preharvest interventions.
