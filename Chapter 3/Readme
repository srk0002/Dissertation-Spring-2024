Salmonella is a zoonotic enteropathogen that causes significant disease in humans and livestock animals. To combat this problem, viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages) are being viewed as a natural and novel way of reducing foodborne pathogens. It is important to select the best phage when designing a mixture or cocktail bacteriophage. Many in vitro methods have been used to select optimum phage. A methodology published by Trotereau and Schouler (2019) examined the use of an avian embryo lethality assay to assess the efficacy of phage against a pathogen (Trotereau and Schouler, 2019). This study examines phage in an avian embryo lethality assay to reduce Salmonella. This study also examines the avian embryo lethality assay and virulence in Salmonella variants.
